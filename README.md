## Introduction to idea Open Info API for Ports
All the large commercial ports manage a logistics area where goods can change their mode of transport. Specifically from the sea side (vessels) to the land side (trucks or trains) and vice versa. This activity is specified in:
- Vessels that arrive to port, load and unload their cargo (usually in containers/trailers or as a bulk cargo),
- Port companies that facilitate the access and berthing of the vessel,
- Stevedores who operate the cranes and take the equipments or cargo to the storage spaces,
- Trucks that bring or take the goods from the port,
- Trains that are loaded and unloaded and that will carry the goods to a destination in the hinterland.

All these activities are carried out under:
- An intense documentary exchange between the port operators,
- A strict surveillance of the port authorities that the administrative, working, personal and environmental safety conditions, etc. are met,
- The need to increase the efficiency of logistics processes, offering more **information services** in real time,
- The need to **increase the transparency** of what happens in the port, which citizens demand from public administrations.

This project is oriented to the last two points, and therefore:
- Identify information types of a Harbour.
- To define APIs to show port state.
- And do it following actual standards:
  - HTTP protocol
  - OAS 3.x Open API Specification
  - API REST
  - JSON:API

## About [Ports 4.0](https://ports40.es/static/ports_40)

The **Ports 4,0** equity fund is the corporate open innovation model adopted by the **Spanish State Port Authorities** to attract, support and facilitate the application of talent and entrepreneurship to the Spanish public and private ports sector, within the context of 4th industrial revolution.

The main target of the Fund is to actively ***promote and incorporate disruptive or incremental innovation*** as a competitiveness, efficiency, sustainability, security and protection element, in the Spanish public and private logistics-ports sector, to facilitate its transition towards economy 4.0.

Ports 4,0 will ***stimulate the creation or consolidation of a factory of emergent companies*** (Startups), spin-offs or new business lines, within the technological scope, in existing companies developing innovative market-driven products, services or processes for the ports logistics sector.
