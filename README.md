## Introduction to idea Open Info API for Ports
All the large commercial ports manage a logistics space dedicated to the exchange of means of transport of goods. Specifically from the marine environment (ships) to the land environment (truck or train) and vice versa. This activity is specified in:
- Ships that arrive to port, load and unload the merchandise (normally in containers, or in bulk),
- Port companies that facilitate the access and berthing of the ship,
- Stevedores who operate the cranes and take the merchandise to the storage spaces,
- Trucks that bring or take the goods from the port,
- Trains that are loaded and unloaded and that will transport the goods to a destination in the hinterland

All these activities are carried out under:
- An intense documentary exchange between the port operators,
- A strict surveillance of the port authorities that the administrative, working, personal and environmental safety conditions, etc. are met,
- The need to increase the efficiency of logistics processes, offering more **information services** in real time,
- The need to **increase the transparency** of what happens in the port, which citizens demand from public administrations.

This project is oriented to the last two points, and therefore:
- a
