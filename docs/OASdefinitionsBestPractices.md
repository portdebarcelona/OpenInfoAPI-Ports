# Best practices in defining API

We need to stablish some rules in defining APIs. For this reason we have been inspired in preceding efforts. Being that this openapi will be based in Restful services where JSON will be the data format of communications, we have been looking for some standard or best practices. Really doesn't exist a standard, but every webservice have solved this questions the best it<> could. We appreciate this attempt to define a [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/) standard, and we will use:

- **https://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/**

## Best practices applied in this project
These are the guidelines applied in this project:

We have undertaked a comparison between several API style guides. We have looked for some generic APIs, not specific for a sector, and then we have choosen these guidelines that will be applied in this project.

### API for requests

- Look at DSCA API design principles 1.0 (it is a guidelines where requests are specified - on concreta molt b√© com s'han de fer els requests)
### API for responses

- JSON formats for answers (look at jsonapi.org, or the Google guidelines)
