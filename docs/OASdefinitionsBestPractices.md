# Best practices in defining API

We need to stablish some rules in defining APIs. For this reason we have been inspired in preceding efforts. Being that this openapi will be based in Restful services where JSON will we the data format of communications, we have been looking for some standard or best practices. Really doesn't exist a standard, but every webservice have solved this questions thes best he could. We appreciate this attempt to define a [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/)  standard, and we will use:

- **https://jsonapi.org/format/1.1/**
