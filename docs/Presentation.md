## Presentation

Open Info API for ports is the brainchild of Enric Rodellas and Jaume Bagot, both employees of the Port of Barcelona.

The idea is to develop a set of open and standardized APIs, in order to provide information on the status of the port in real time.

Port information, because we believe that there is a great demand and high use of information services by the Logistics Community. And, in addition, citizens demand more transparency and ease of access to the data of the administrations.

Open and standardized, as part of a strategy aimed at its general use and that it can be replicated in other ports.

Without going into detail, we are thinking of developing APIs with information on meteorology, state of the sea, pollution, vehicle traffic in the port, railway entrances and exits, ship stopovers, terminals, merchandise inspections and others ...

This proposal is based on the FAIR and RISP principles.

To execute the project, we will use open and standard technologies such as http for data transport, OpenAPI for the definition of the catalog, JSON as the exchange format and REST as the protocol between the applications.

The deliverables of this idea will be: a catalog of information that the ports can use and that will contain the definition of information types and their attributes. All this defined in OpenAPI with its description and examples published on GitHub.

We plan to focus in a first phase on the information that can be provided by the port authorities, although the idea is scalable and the possibility of creating a Marketplace at a later stage is envisaged to give entry to other actors.

Regarding the impact on the sector, we understand that it will manifest itself in three aspects such as transparency, port operations and the improvement of forecast management.

The ease of integration into the operators' applications will be achieved through the development of a standardized catalog, the definition of standard APIs and an offer of information through PCS and other platforms, such as SIMPLE, for example.

We are talking about valuable information for the sector such as:
Time of access to terminals, useful for planning by traffic managers
The weather forecast, of interest for maritime operations and terminal operations
Approach maneuvers to support port services operations
Or the scales of the ships, of interest to the consignees, freight forwarders and customs agents.

To end this presentation, we highlight that its added value is based on the following pillars: transparency, scalable solution, open specifications and own data coherence.

All this will facilitate public-private cooperation, the development of a Marketplace and the design of a solution resistant to technological changes.
