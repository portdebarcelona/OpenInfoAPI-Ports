# Project presentation

This document is a brief introduction to the "Open Info API para Puertos" project, developed under the Ports 4.0 from Ports of Spain Tradetech Fund.

Below, is a powerpoint presentation and a youtube video made in the initial stages of the project.

## Presentation

### Open Info API

**Open Info API** for ports is an Idea developed by Enric Rodellas and Jaume Bagot, both employees of the Port of Barcelona.

### Purpose

The purpouse of the Idea is to develop a set of open and standardized APIs, to provide **information on the status of the port** in real time.

Port information, because we believe that there is a great demand and high use of information services by the Logistics Community. And, in addition, citizens demand more transparency and ease of access to the data of the administrations.

Open and standardized, as part of a strategy aimed at the generalisation of its use and that it can be replicated in other ports.

### Examples

Without going into detail, we are thinking of developing APIs with information on meteorology, state of the sea, pollution, vehicle traffic in the port, railway entrances and exits, ship stopovers, terminals, merchandise inspections and others ...

### Technology

This proposal is based on the FAIR and RISP principles.

- **FAIR**: Findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
- **RISP**: Reutilización de la información del Sector Público

To execute the project, we will use open and standard technologies such as:

- **HTTP** for data transport,
- **OpenAPI** for the definition of the catalogue,
- **JSON** as the exchange format and
- **REST** (REpresentational State Transfer) as the protocol between the applications.

### Deliverables

The deliverables of this idea will be a **catalogue of information** that the ports can use and that will contain the definition of information types and their attributes. All this defined in OpenAPI with its description and examples published on GitHub.

We plan to focus in a first phase on the information that can be provided by the port authorities, although the idea is scalable and the possibility of creating a Marketplace at a later stage is envisaged to give entry to other actors.

In this six-month phase, deliverables will be:

- Definition of the **types of information**
- **Attributes** of each type of information
- Definition in **OpenAPI 3.0**
- **Description and examples** in GitHub

### Expected impact on logistic sector

Regarding the impact on the sector, we understand that it will manifest itself in three aspects such as transparency, port operations and the improvement of forecast management.

The ease of integration into the operators' applications will be achieved through the development of a standardized catalogue, the definition of standard APIs and an offer of information through PCS and other platforms, such as SIMPLE, for example.

We are talking about valuable information for the sector such as:

- Time of access to terminals, useful for planning by traffic managers
- The weather forecast, of interest for maritime operations and terminal operations
- Approach manoeuvres to support port services operations
- Ship calls, interesting to the ship agents, freight forwarders and customs agents.

## Added value

To end this presentation, we highlight that its added value is based on the following pillars:

- transparency,
- scalable solution,
- open specifications,
- data coherence

All this will **facilitate public-private cooperation**, the development of a Marketplace and the design of a solution resistant to technological changes.
