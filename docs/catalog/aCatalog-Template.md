- **Border Controls**

  The border inspection post (BIP) is a controlled and authorised station for customs and sanitary controls of goods. Physical and documentary inspections are carried out at these posts as well as analysis of samples.
  
  A Border Control Post is an inspection post designated and approved in line with EU legislation for carrying out checks on animals and animal products arriving from third countries at a European Union border. These checks are carried out to protect animal and public health, and animal welfare.
  
  As a part of the border clearance process, border inspection services can carry out docummentary or physical inspections, and those can be carried out inside the cargo terminals but usually the physical inspections are carried out at the Border Inspection Posts (BIP), where coexist several specific inspection areas as a designated point of import (DPI), a designated point of entry (DPE) or a border control post (BCP).  
 
  It is the recipient's responsibility to know the conditions for importing their shipment (prohibitions, restrictions, limitations, etc.) and to find out what documents may be required on arrival, including the commercial invoice, certificate of origin, licences and special certifications for border controls, etc.

- **VGM (Verified Gross Mass)**

  As the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) declare: *"discrepancies between the declared gross mass and the actual gross mass of a packed container could have an adverse impact on the safety of the ship, seafarers and shore-side workers, by leading to incorrect vessel stowage decisions and potentially collapsed container stacks or loss of containers overboard"*.

  The IMO established a requirement that packed containers must be weighed to obtain their actual gross mass prior to vessel loading.  This requirement is included in the Guidelines regarding the verified gross mass of a container carrying cargo (MSC.1/Circ.1475) and the adoption of amendment to SOLAS regulation VI/2 requires the mandatory verification of the gross mass of packed containers (resolution MSC.380(94)).

  The aforementioned SOLAS amendments introduce two main new requirements:
  1. the shipper is responsible for providing the verified weight by stating it in the shipping document and submitting it to the master or his representative and to the terminal representative sufficiently in advance to be used in the preparation of the ship stowage plan; and 
  2. the verified gross mass is a condition for loading a packed container onto a ship.
  
  A prerequisite for the container to be loaded onto a ship to which the SOLAS regulations apply is the availability of the verified gross mass of a packed container sufficiently in advance to the terminal representative and to the master or his representative to be used in the ship stowage plan.  However, it does not constitute an entitlement for loading, because the master retains ultimate discretion in deciding whether to accept a packed container for loading onto his ship.

  The verification of the gross mass can be achieved by either of two methods:
  1. weighing the packed container; or
  2. weighing all packages and cargo items, including the mass of pallets, dunnage and other securing material to be packed in the container and adding the tare mass of the container to the sum of the single masses, using a certified method approved by the competent authority of the State in which packing of the container was completed.

- **Quality Level Certifications**  
 
  Several ports have developed own brands for their quality label schemas.
  There are some ports that every day manage the transportation of thousands of shipments. And the job of each port is to treat each one as it was the only one. To ensure that each shipment receives the treatment it deserves, some ports have created a quality brand that identifies the companies operating at that port that had adopted a commitment to efficiency the end customers with the utmost satisfaction. With this quality level the ports recognise and certify organisations involved and commited to the most rigorous standards of reliability.

  To know which companies have this quality level can be very useful for the users of a port.

### Statistics 

  Ports are ranked nationally and internationally, and they are compared in many different ways, i.e. by volume or value of trade, the number of TEUs, tones or cruise passengers, revenues, quays length, or storage capacity.

  All the ports have statistical information about the activity. Relevant data of a port can be:
  - Value of goods passing through the port (euros)
  - Number of ship calls (stopovers)
  - Tones loaded/unloaded by sector (energy, vehicles and transport elements, agro-livestock and food, chemicals, iron and steel, building materials, fertilisers, non-metallic minerals, other goods)
  - Traffic by geographical areas (total, main destination areas and main areas of origin)(tones)
  - Goods by type of packaging and shipping (container load, conventional charge, liquid bulk or dry bulk)(tones)
  - Container traffic (all, full/empty, import/export)(TEU)
  - Vehicles loaded/unloaded (units)
  - Liquid bulk loaded/unloaded (tones)
  - Solid bulk loaded/unloaded (tones)
  - Short sea shipping (intermodal transport units (UTI))
  - Container rail traffic (TEU)
  - Container rail share (%)
  - Vehicle rail traffic (units)
  - Vehicle rail share (%) 
  - Passengers embarked/disembarked (units)
  - Cruise passengers embarked/disembarked (units)
  - Economic concepts:
    - Turnover (thousand euro)
    - Port fees (thousand euro)

### Environment: Weather
 
Several activities at ports, such as berthing, dredging or construction typically require low weather energy conditions for safe execution. 

  Information can assist harbour masters, port pilots, tug masters, mooring officers, and port engineers to make decisions and help them increase safety and efficiency of marine operations in ports.

  Real time information about weather can optimise the scheduling of shipping movements, can minimise weather downtime, can optimise berth use reducing cargo transit delays, can aware of hazardous conditions off coast, can forecast long wave and surging conditions

### Environment: Pollution 

Pollution from port activities can affect the quality of the air and also the waters. Environmental noise is also another kind of pollution from ports. 

Major air pollutants generated by port activities include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM).

Ports also concentrate industrial areas next to the water and many activities of the ports, such as transportation, terminal operations, cargo handling, storage and boat repair all can have potential impacts on water quality if an incident were to occur.  

The presence in ports of diverse sound from ships, trucks, cranes and also from industrial and ship-yards activities as well as auxiliary services produces negative effects on natural ecosystem and the urban population. This is the noise po√±√±ution.

  - [catalog](catalog/catalog-Pollution.md)



### Rail transport

Rail transport is reliable and extremely suitable for heavy cargoes, including cars, chemical tanks and containers. One train takes an average of 45 trucks off the road. Rail transport for goods makes the logistical chain at the port much more sustainable and efficient. 

Containers are ideal for intermodal transport, including by rail. In intermodal transport, containers arriving by sea can be transported further by rail to their final destination in the hinterland.

Sometime ports have high-frequency rail shuttles between the port and several inland terminals and the knowledge of these rail transport connections is key for port operators.

There are ports with a few dozen trains that arrive or depart everyday and logistic operators need traceability of their movements, including their estimated time of arrival (ETA) and estimated time of departure (ETD).
