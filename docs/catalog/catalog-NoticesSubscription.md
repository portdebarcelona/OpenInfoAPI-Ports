# Port notices subscription specification

## Definition
Often, Port Authorities have to publish some notices (meteorological alerts, port procedures, etc). Normally these notices are sent by mail and sms, and published in the web. But also is necessary to publish in web services.

Some notices are intended for the port community, and others are intended for the general public. Also, each notice is of interest to some subgroups of the port community, such as ship agents, shipping companies, transport companies, stevedore,  concessionaire, etc.
