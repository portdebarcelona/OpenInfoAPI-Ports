# Weather Alerts specification

## Definition
Several activities at ports, such as berthing, dredging or construction typically require low weather energy conditions for safe execution. 

Information can assist harbour masters, port pilots, tug masters, mooring officers, and port engineers to make decisions and help them increase safety and efficiency of marine operations in ports.

Real time information about weather can optimise the scheduling of shipping movements, can minimise weather downtime, can optimise berth use reducing cargo transit delays, can aware of hazardous conditions off coast, can forecast long wave and surging conditions.

This API offers weather alerts for a port.
