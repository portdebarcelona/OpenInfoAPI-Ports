# Introduction to the catalog of APIs
This catalog enumerates a list of APIs with information about ports that can be useful for the logistic activities and also for the citiens that want to know more about ports.

## Categories

Use of **Categories**. Many concepts are common in all ports (e.g., port services). It is advisable to use a category field that would allow better filtering and precise referencing.

### Ships Calls


![Anchor](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2693.png?v8)




Information about vessel's voyages in the port is particularly useful for planning logistic operations, but it can also be useful for acompanying or waiting people that will depart or arrive by ferry or cruise.

This category reffers to all available information about vessels and their voyages within the port, such as their port calls or their voyages, including their stay number and the information about the vessel, such as IMO, lenght, tonnage, .

### Port Procedures (Work in progress)

  ![Ft](https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports/blob/develop/docs/images/Ft3.png?raw=true)

Certain operations require some procedure instructions and these procedures should be published and accessible to several applications. 

Here are some examples of APIs that can facilitate information of some of these procedures:

- **Customs Controls and Inspections**

  Customs can carry out their physical inspections inside the cargo terminals, at the terminal yard or in a warehouse, but they can also inspect containers, platforms or trucks using a non-intrusive technology as an X-ray scanner. Operators need to know which units have been selected to be inspected by Customs, to know if the inspection has been carried out and whether the goods have been cleared. 
  
  Possible APIs:
  - Customs Inspections
    - Request parameters: equipment id. 
    - Data included in the response: unit of cargo selected for inspection (true/false), type of inspection (intrusive/non-intrusive), place of the inspection (container yard, bonded warehouse,..), status (pending/carried out/cleared,...),...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-CustomsInspections.md)   

- **Border Control Posts (BCP)**


  A Border Control Post is an inspection post designated and approved in line with EU legislation for carrying out checks on animals and animal products arriving from third countries at a European Union border. These checks are carried out to protect animal and public health, and animal welfare.
  Operators need to know which units have been selected by the Sanitary Authorities to be inspected, to know if the inspection has been performed and if their goods have been cleared.

  Possible APIs:
  - Border Control Posts
    - Request parameters: equipment id. 
    - Data included in the response: unit of cargo selected for inspection (true/false), border inspection service (phytosanitary, veterinary, pharmacy, health, quality and industrial regulations,...), type of inspection (container emptying, container emptying and classification, identity, inspection, opening but not inspected, "passad√≠s", resealing, resealed but not openned, thermodesinfection, transfer of goods, ventilation, fumigation, fumigation check...), place of the inspection (container yard, border inspection post, designated point of import (DPI), designated point of entry (DPE)), positioning reasons (inspection, customer requirements, others), status (pending/carried out/cleared,...),...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-BorderInspections.md)   


- **VGM (Verified Gross Mass)**

  As the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) declare: *"discrepancies between the declared gross mass and the actual gross mass of a packed container could have an adverse impact on the safety of the ship, seafarers and shore-side workers, by leading to incorrect vessel stowage decisions and potentially collapsed container stacks or loss of containers overboard"*.

  The IMO established a requirement that packed containers must be weighed to obtain their actual gross mass prior to vessel loading.  This requirement is included in the Guidelines regarding the verified gross mass of a container carrying cargo (MSC.1/Circ.1475) and the adoption of amendment to SOLAS regulation VI/2 requires the mandatory verification of the gross mass of packed containers (resolution MSC.380(94)).

  The aforementioned SOLAS amendments introduce two main new requirements:
  1. the shipper is responsible for providing the verified weight by stating it in the shipping document and submitting it to the master or his representative and to the terminal representative sufficiently in advance to be used in the preparation of the ship stowage plan; and 
  2. the verified gross mass is a condition for loading a packed container onto a ship.
  
  A prerequisite for the container to be loaded onto a ship to which the SOLAS regulations apply is the availability of the verified gross mass of a packed container sufficiently in advance to the terminal representative and to the master or his representative to be used in the ship stowage plan.  However, it does not constitute an entitlement for loading, because the master retains ultimate discretion in deciding whether to accept a packed container for loading onto his ship.

  The verification of the gross mass can be achieved by either of two methods:
  1. weighing the packed container; or
  2. weighing all packages and cargo items, including the mass of pallets, dunnage and other securing material to be packed in the container and adding the tare mass of the container to the sum of the single masses, using a certified method approved by the competent authority of the State in which packing of the container was completed.

  Possible APIs:

  - VGM
    - Request parameters: equipment id, request of weighting or VGM communication,... 
    - Data included in the response: method of weighting, VGM,...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-VGM.md)  

- **Efficiency Network Certificate** 

  ![Efficiency Network](https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports/blob/develop/docs/images/EN.png?raw=true)

  Efficiency Network is the brand of the Barcelona Port's quality label.
  The Port of Barcelona every day manages the transportation of thousands of shipments. The job of the Port is to treat each one as it was the only one.

    - Request parameters: activity, name of the company,... 
    - Data included in the response: name of the company, activities, company certified (true or false),...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-EfficiencyNetwork.md)  

- **Container release or acceptance (Container pick-up or delivery from/to the terminal or depot)** 

  ![Camio](https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports/blob/develop/docs/images/camio2.png?raw=true)
 
  Container traffic has a big economic impact in ports and the area that they serve.
   
  Container operations in ports are docummented using EDI messages. The EDIFACT container messages are designed to provide standard formats for all functional areas related to the handling and movement of shipping containers and equipment.
  They are divided into two main categories: ship and land operations.
  In this category are included some APIs related with the information exchanged using the EDI messages for land operations with full and empty containers.

  Possible APIs:

  - Container release information (container pick-up from the terminal or depot)
    - Request parameters: container number, full/empty indicator 
    - Data included in the response: container number, full/empty indicator, name of the container terminal or depot, status (pending, authorised, exited,...)...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-ContainerRelease.md) 

  - Container acceptance information (container delivery from the terminal or depot)
    - Request parameters: container number, full/empty indicator  
    - Data included in the response: container number, full/empty indicator, name of the container terminal or depot, status (pending, authorised, entered,...)...
    - [catalog](catalog/catalog-ContainerAcceptance.md) 

    




- **Approach instructions** (PENDING)
 
  ![Approach](https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports/blob/develop/docs/images/approach3.png?raw=true)

  Port of Barcelona has two entrances - North and South - and each one has its own approach channel.

  APPROACH CHANNELS

    Approach channels consist of two traffic separation schemes guiding ships to/from north and south entrances respectively.
    The separation line of the northern approach channel is indicated by a fairway buoy charted name ‚ÄúNovember - N‚Äù and is equipped with a radio beacon signal (racon) that it appears on X-Band radars as letter ‚ÄúN‚Äù of the Morse code.
    The separation line of the southern approach channel is indicated by a fairway buoy charted name ‚ÄúSierra ‚Äì S‚Äù and is equipped with a radio beacon signal (racon) that it appears on X-Band radars as the letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù of the Morse code.

  PRECAUTIONARY AREAS

  Two Precautionary Areas have been set between the end of both approach channels and the port entrances.

  PORT TRAFFIC

  In Barcelona port waters the vessel traffic service (VTS) is provided by ‚ÄòBarcelona Port Control‚Äô.

  Inbound Vessels-Reporting Points:  
  
  One hour prior to arrival at the fairway buoy ships must contact 'Barcelona Traffic' on VHF channel 10 and "Barcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14.
  
  Two miles before passing the ‚ÄúSierra‚Äù fairway buoy ships must contact ‚ÄúBarcelona Traffic‚Äù on VHF channel 10 and ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14.
  
  Four miles before passing the ‚ÄúNovember‚Äù fairway buoy ships must contact ‚ÄúBarcelona Traffic‚Äù on VHF channel 10 and ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14.
  
  Nevertheless, the High Speed Crafts must report in both cases when they are four miles off the fairway buoy.

  Outbound or Shifting Vessels-Reporting Points

  One hour before expected departure or shifting, vessels have to contact ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14.

  Twenty minutes before departure or shifting, vessels have to contact ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14 in order to request port services and/or obtain permission to depart.

  Passing fairway buoy must contact ‚ÄúBarcelona Traffic‚Äù on VHF channel 10 and ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äùon VHF channel 14.

  Radio Watch
  
  From one hour prior to arrival to two miles away from the ‚ÄúSierra‚Äù fairway buoy or four miles away from ‚ÄúNovember‚Äù fairway buoy and vice versa, ships will maintain a continuous listening watch on VHF channels 10 and 16, and, if possible, VHF channel 14.

  From two miles away from the fairway buoy or four miles away from ‚ÄúNovember‚Äù fairway buoy up to be berthed and vice versa, ships will maintain a continuous listening watch on VHF channels
  14 and 16, and, if possible, VHF channel 10.
  
  OTHER INFORMATION 
  
  Emergency

  In case of emergency on board, the following stations are on permanent duty 24 hours a day:
  - ‚ÄúBarcelona Traffic‚Äù on VHF channel 10
  - ‚ÄúBarcelona Port Control‚Äù on VHF channel 14

  All ships in the port have to follow the instructions given by Port Emergency Plan authorities unless they have overriding contradictory safety reasons which then have to be immediately reported to the authorities.

  Ships are requested to inform the aforementioned reporting stations any pollution observed on port waters.

### Statistics (PENDING)
![Approach](https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports/blob/develop/docs/images/statistics3.png?raw=true)

  Ports are ranked nationally and internationally, and they are compared in many different ways, i.e. by volume or value of trade, the number of TEUs, tones or cruise passengers, revenues, quays length, or storage capacity.

  Moreover, the size of a port, in terms of traffic flow, says nothing about productivity, efficiency, or responsiveness to customers. These are just some of the criteria that a shipper might consider in evaluating port performance.

  All the ports have statistical information about the activity. Usually are published annually, monthly, quarterly. Relevant data of a port are:
  - Number ship calls
  - Tones loaded/unloaded
  - Number of containers
  - Vehicles loaded/unloaded
  - Passengers embarked/disembarked
  - Liquid bulks loaded/unloaded
  - Solid bulks loaded/unloaded
  - Economic concepts
  - etc.

### Weather (Work in progress)
![Sun with cloud and rain](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f326.png?v8)  
Several activities at ports, such as berthing, dredging or construction typically require low weather energy conditions for safe execution. 

  Information can assist harbour masters, port pilots, tug masters, mooring officers, and port engineers to make decisions and help them increase safety and efficiency of marine operations in ports.

  Real time information about weather can optimise the scheduling of shipping movements, can minimise weather downtime, can optimise berth use reducing cargo transit delays, can aware of hazardous conditions off coast, can forecast long wave and surging conditions



    ...wind forecasts: trained upon in-port or near-port wind observations, these forecasts let you precisely judge the percentage risk of high winds from one hour ahead to one week ahead.

### Sea State (Work in progress)
![Ocean](https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f30a.png?v8)

Puertos del Estado offers a service called SAPO (that in Spanish corresponds to the initials of Autonomous Wave Prediction System) to the Port Authorities that request it.

This service allows obtaining a local wave prediction with a horizon of 48 hours considering the transformations induced by the coastline and the continental shelf. The forecast covers a region of about 600 km2 in the area outside the port with a wave generation and scheduling model and the interior area of the port with an agitation model.
