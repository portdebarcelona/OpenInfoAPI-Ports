# Working environment
To work in this project we have chosen and setup a set of tools. Here we explain which tools we use. Each decision is a balance between functionalities and ease of use. Questions like:
- Editor
- Repository of code
- Web site
- Editor of OAS


## Open API editor
Main goal is define and publish webservices wiht OAS3.x specification. We chose [Open API (swagger) extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi)

## Web pages
Because github.com facilitates Gitpages processes with Jekyll.

## Name of Code repository
**OpenInfoAPI-Ports**, then https://github.com/portdebarcelona/OpenInfoAPI-Ports. In a initial phase is under domain 'portofbarcelona'. In a future we will see.

## Code repository
Because our company (portofbarcelona) uses **Github.com**, this will be our code and documentation repository.

## Editor
**VSCode**: Visual Studio Code Editor is an outstanding editor that has many plugins and connection with git repositories
