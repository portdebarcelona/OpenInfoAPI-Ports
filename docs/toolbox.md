# Toolbox
- The toolbox is a uniform framework for the API specification and it is independent from the area of application (trade, port infrastructure, procedures, weather, companies directory, news, etc.).
- Several tools are part of the API specification framework, as the: 
## Business requirements specifications 
- We need to know the business processes that are behind.
- The scope is specified in terms of the Business Processes that are involved and the data elements about which information is to be exchanged by the participants who are involved directly in the Information Exchanges that support the related business process.
- We have to identify all the use cases
## Reference data model
- A wide reference data model (or information model) must be created, covering all the data that could be shared as a part of the Open Info API for Ports project. 
- A reference dta model is a logical subset, of a wide set of the data elements, that represents a given context.
- There have been defined several sectorial data models, like the EUCDM (EU Customs Data Model), IMO,... And there are also more wide data models as the UN/CEFACT Reference Data Models (RDMS) like the Buy Ship Pay Reference Data Model or the Supply Chain Reference Data Model.
- All these data models cover a specific area but none of them covers all the data of the Open Info API for Ports project. 
- The definition of data model is also a semantics issue, because the existence of a common data model will facilitate the alignment of terms across the diferent categories of information shared with our APIs.
- Based on a common semantic to ensure the data shared can be understood in the same way by all the API consumers.
- The data model describes haw data are organised and how they are related.
- Common understanding
- Harmonizing the terminology, with clear definitions of what is what.
- Semantic interoperability
## API design rules

## Open API specification
- From this specification, programme code can be generated automatically.
