# Air and Water Pollution specification

## Definition
Pollution from port activities can affect the quality of the air and also the waters. Environmental noise is also another kind of pollution from ports. 

Major air pollutants generated by port activities include carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM).

Ports also concentrate industrial areas next to the water and many activities of the ports, such as transportation, terminal operations, cargo handling, storage and boat repair all can have potential impacts on water quality if an incident were to occur.  

This API offers information on current air and water quality of a port. 

## Endpoint
