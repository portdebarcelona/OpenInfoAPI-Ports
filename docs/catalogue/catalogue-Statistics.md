# Traffic statistics specification

## Definition
Ports are ranked nationally and internationally, and they are compared in many different ways, i.e. by volume or value of trade, the number of TEUs, tones or cruise passengers, revenues, quays length, or storage capacity.
All the ports have statistical information about the activity. Relevant data of a port can be:
  - Value of goods passing through the port (euros)
  - Number of ship calls (stopovers)
  - Tones loaded/unloaded by sector (energy, vehicles and transport elements, agro-livestock and food, chemicals, iron and steel, building materials, fertilisers, non-metallic minerals, other goods)
  - Traffic by geographical areas (total, main destination areas and main areas of origin)(tones)
  - Goods by type of packaging and shipping (container load, conventional charge, liquid bulk or dry bulk)(tones)
  - Container traffic (all, full/empty, import/export)(TEU)
  - Vehicles loaded/unloaded (units)
  - Liquid bulk loaded/unloaded (tones)
  - Solid bulk loaded/unloaded (tones)
  - Short sea shipping (intermodal transport units (UTI))
  - Container rail traffic (TEU)
  - Container rail share (%)
  - Vehicle rail traffic (units)
  - Vehicle rail share (%) 
  - Passengers embarked/disembarked (units)
  - Cruise passengers embarked/disembarked (units)
And it is also important to know how often the data can be obtained and published.
