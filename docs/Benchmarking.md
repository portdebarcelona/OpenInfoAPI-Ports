## ShipCalls
There are many implementations about shipcalls. Ens hem fixat amb alguns dels principals.
### Definitions and Implementations
**Definitions**: About definition and content of ship calls we remark:
- [BERMAN message in Puertos Del Estado](http://www.puertos.es/Documents/BERMAN%204.1.2%20v1.0.pdf) and also [UNCEFACT](https://service.unece.org/trade/untdid/latest/trmd/berman_c.htm). Main standard used to request a ship call sent by shipagents to Port Authorities.
- [DCSA Just in Time Port Call](https://dcsa.org/initiatives/just-in-time-port-call/). Proposal procedure with aim to synchronize ship calls with port operations. And furthermore wants to reduce pollution at port areas.
- [SMDG Vessel schedules](https://newsmdg.de/documents/edifact-migs-message-implementation-guidelines/vessel-schedules/). EDIFACT Messsage Implementation Guideline for vessel arrival/departures schedules (VESDEP), alternative to BERMAN message. 
### Discussion
A ship call is defined by these main concepts: IMO ship identification number and name of ship, Port of origin, Port of call, Berth, date and time expected (or actual) of arrival, date and time expected (or actual) of departure , and Port of Destination. The type of ship is also included (e.g.: container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, ferries, cruise ships, car carriers, Ropax).

The EDIFACT messages mentioned include much more information on the scales of the ships, their characteristics, their cargo and the services required (mooring, towing, pilotage, waste collection). In this proposal, only the 'core' part of the standardized messages will be used, as stated in the previous paragraph.
