# Project approach

## Top-down approach
- A top-down approach will be followed to define the data model, following this steps:
  1. Identification of the **domains** that will be covered in the project.
  2. Identification of several **APIs** for each domain.
  3. Possible **input and output parameters** of those APIs.
  4. From parameters to **entities and their attributes**.
  5. **Data model** specification: entities and attributes that are properties or relationships.

## Domains
- Although it is a list that can always be expanded, the following domains appear in its initial version:
  1. **Ships Calls**. Information about actual or planned ships calls at a specific port. Including scheduled arrivals and departures.
  2. **Liner Services**. Information of liner services, carriers involved and ports serviced. 
  3. **Port Infrastructure**. Basic data of the infrastructure of a port, its land and sea accesses, its terminals and its railway infrastructure. 
  4. **Port Procedures**. Links to the websites where all port procedures of a port are described.
  5. **Statistics**. Traffic and economic statistics of a port.
  6. **Environment**
  7. **Rail Transport**
  8. **Vehicle Traffic Monitoring**
  9. **Terminals**
  10. **News**
  11. **Notices**
  12. **Port Rates and Fees**
  13. **Port Services**
  14. **Port Calendar**
  15. **Port Directory**

## APIs (Some examples)
- [Here](./CatalogIntroduction.md) there are some examples of possible APIs.

## APIs' Input and Output Parameters
- Within the [catalog of APIs](./CatalogIntroduction.md), accompaining each example of API, there is also a list with its input and output parameters.

## Entities and attributes
- The parameters identified in each API can be classified as entities or atributtes of some entities.
