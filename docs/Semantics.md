# Semantics

## Semantics is key for the API standardisation
- As it is mentioned in the document: Briefing note on the importance of Semantics within Trade
Facilitation and Electronic Business for SDG 17, Note by the Secretariat, Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business:
  -  Semantics, in the context of electronic data exchange, is the unambiguous meaning of
each of the pieces of information to be shared between sender, receiver and any stakeholder
who views or uses the information.
  - Semantic standards describe the clear meaning of the information to be shared, whether
it be in the business processes or in the electronic data exchange messages themselves. This
paper aims to explain why UN/CEFACT deems this to be essential to its mission and to
international trade in general.
