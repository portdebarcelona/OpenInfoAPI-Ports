These checks are carried out to protect animal and public health, and animal welfare. As a part of the border clearance process, border inspection services can carry out docummentary or physical inspections, and those can be carried out inside the cargo terminals but usually the physical inspections are carried out at the Border Inspection Posts (BIP), where coexist several specific inspection areas as a designated point of import (DPI), a designated point of entry (DPE) or a border control post (BCP). It is the recipient''s responsibility to know the conditions for importing their shipment (prohibitions, restrictions, limitations, etc.) and to find out what documents may be required on arrival, including the commercial invoice, certificate of origin, licences and special certifications for border controls, etc.']

              enum: ['As the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) declare: *"discrepancies between the declared gross mass and the actual gross mass of a packed container could have an adverse impact on the safety of the ship, seafarers and shore-side workers, by leading to incorrect vessel stowage decisions and potentially collapsed container stacks or loss of containers overboard"*. The IMO established a requirement that packed containers must be weighed to obtain their actual gross mass prior to vessel loading.  This requirement is included in the Guidelines regarding the verified gross mass of a container carrying cargo (MSC.1/Circ.1475) and the adoption of amendment to SOLAS regulation VI/2 requires the mandatory verification of the gross mass of packed containers (resolution MSC.380(94)). The aforementioned SOLAS amendments introduce two main new requirements:  1. the shipper is responsible for providing the verified weight by stating it in the shipping document and submitting it to the master or his representative and to the terminal representative sufficiently in advance to be used in the preparation of the ship stowage plan; and  2. the verified gross mass is a condition for loading a packed container onto a ship. A prerequisite for the container to be loaded onto a ship to which the SOLAS regulations apply is the availability of the verified gross mass of a packed container sufficiently in advance to the terminal representative and to the master or his representative to be used in the ship stowage plan.  However, it does not constitute an entitlement for loading, because the master retains ultimate discretion in deciding whether to accept a packed container for loading onto his ship. The verification of the gross mass can be achieved by either of two methods: 1. weighing the packed container; or 2. weighing all packages and cargo items, including the mass of pallets, dunnage and other securing material to be packed in the container and adding the tare mass of the container to the sum of the single masses, using a certified method approved by the competent authority of the State in which packing of the container was completed.']
